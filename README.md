# ft_linear_regression

In this project, the aim was to implement a linear regression with one variable.

### Train your program
Just execute ```python train.py [data.csv]``` where data.csv is a 2-columns csv file, with the first line as data names.

At the end of execution, the program will generate a graph with scatter plots in red, and the computed slope in red

The trainer will create a file named theta_data.csv.

### Guess a feature
```python3 train.py [theta_data.csv]``` will ask you your first column value, then return the feature value.
